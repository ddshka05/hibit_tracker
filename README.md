# Habit Tracker
Helps to track my habits. My first project on Python. 

## Functions
1. User can add habits which they want to track. He need to write:
    - name of the habit.
    - discrition of the habit (the accurate discription what he or she should do to be sure he keep doing this habit).

2. User can get information about habit:
    - how many days user keep doing it.
    - last time user did it.
    - discription of the habit.

3. User can get notifications about his current everyday habits. They get:
    - name of the habit.
    - discription what to do.

4. User can mark the habit as done. They should only enter the name of the habit.

5. User can delete habits from the list of tracked habits.

## Tecnical features

I use json file to save data about habits. 

## Future development
I think this project will be deployed via Telegram bot to use on your smartphones.
